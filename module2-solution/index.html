        <h1>Ghanaian Foods You Should Try</h1>
        <div class="row">

            <div class="redred">
             <h2>Red Red</h2>
             <p>Perhaps one of the top three street foods in Ghana, Red Red, combined with gari and fried plantain both as sides on a sunny and hot afternoon is as Ghanaian as American pie is American. Red Red is easy to make at home but, for that authentic Ghanaian taste, it’s best to leave it to the expert Red Red vendors dotted all around cities across Ghana. Some of the nation’s finest African restaurants will have it as one of thier signature dishes.</p>

          <div class="kenkey">
            <h2>Kenkey</h2>
            <p>The ubiquitous kenkey is arguably coastal Ghana’s favourite staple. Cheap and cheerful, it lends itself to various combos including grilled tilapia. Grilled tilapia symbolises and gives credence to Ghana’s economic growth or at the very least economic potential. As fishing stock dwindles some of Ghana’s savvy entrepreneurs, such as Mike Amichi, have taken to farming tilapia to keep this fish on our dining tables. Often grilled on open charcoal grills and adorned with chopped onion with shito on the side, grilled tilapia is now a revelation.</p>

        <div class="waakye">
           <h2>Waakye</h2>
           <p>If Red Red is the superman of Ghanaian food, kenkey the batman then Waakye has got to be spiderman. Together these three are what you’d find readily available in every foodie nook and cranny in Ghana. These are the superheroes who wield extraordinary power over the culinary heritage of Ghana. Again like Red Red, waakye is best enjoyed in a restaurant or as street food and like other rice and beans combos it has the unique characteristic of providing you with both carbohydrate and protein – a complete meal indeed.</p>
